                <h1>Our History
                </h1>
                <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
                <p>
                    After numerous covid lockdowns and restriction, we were hoping that someone was going to hosting something for the community regarding an eid celebration.
                    However the last eid festival held in Sheffield was over 10 years ago and the organisers didn't have time to organise the event.
                    We took it upon ourselves to organise one from the ground up, something to celebrate Eid and to give the younger generation who's last 2-3 years were nothing
                    but lock downs left right and center.
                    We held our first event in May 2022, which was a resounding success, however there was many lessons to be learned.
                    This Eid festival will be our fourth and we are forever looking back and addressing feedback from locals, attendies and from our own observations.
                </p>
                <h2>The Core Team</h2>
                <p>
                    Behind every success story is a team of dedicated individuals.
                    We are a group of 10 who volunteer our time and efforts with the same goal in mind, an event for <b>EVERYONE</b>.              
                </p>
                <h2>Our Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to to cater to everyones needs and wants, however impossible that may seem. 
                    Innovation fuels our creativity, pushing us to embrace new challenges and explore uncharted territories. Most 
                    importantly, our community are at the heart of everything we do, listening to their needs and implimenting new ideas and tweaks is our utmost priority.
                </p>
                <h2>Join Us On Our Journey</h2>

                    We are incredibly grateful to our sponsors, volunteers and everyone to attends.
