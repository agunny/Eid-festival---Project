                <h1>Our Origin Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Our journey began with a simple idea - to organize a one-time event where families could escape their busy routines
                    and bask in the delight of wholesome activities. As the team brainstormed and planned, our vision grew into something
                    much greater. We envisioned an annual tradition, a celebration that would become a beacon of happiness for generations
                    to come.
                <h1>The Core Team</h1>
                <p>
                    Behind every success story is a team of dedicated individuals.
                    We are a group of 10 who volunteer our time and efforts with the same goal in mind, an event for <b>EVERYONE</b>.              
                </p>
                <h1>Our Goals</h1>
                <p>
                    We aim to to cater to everyones needs and wants, however impossible that may seem. 
                    Innovation fuels our creativity, pushing us to embrace new challenges and explore uncharted territories. Most 
                    importantly, our community are at the heart of everything we do, listening to their needs and implementing new ideas and tweaks is our utmost priority.
                </p>
                <h1>Join Us On Our Journey</h1>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly grateful to our sponsors, volunteers and everyone to attends.
                    Without the help, these events would not be possible!
