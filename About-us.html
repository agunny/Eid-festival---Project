                <h1>Our Origin Story</h1>
                <p> Our journey began with a simple idea - to organize a one-time event where families could escape
                    their busy routines and bask in the delight of wholesome activities. As the team brainstormed and
                    planned, our vision grew into something much greater. We envisioned an annual tradition, a
                    celebration that would become a beacon of happiness for generations to come. <br>Throughout the day,
                    the Eid Festival team worked tirelessly to ensure everything ran smoothly. The success of the day
                    was just the beginning. Inspired by the positive impact we had on our city, we vowed to continue
                    their mission of spreading joy and unity. To become a beacon of hope for their community, inspiring
                    others to come together, celebrate their diversity, and create a city where every family felt loved
                    and cherished.
                </p>
                <h1>The Core Team</h1>
                <p>
                    Behind every success story is a team of dedicated individuals. United by our faith and the spirit of Eid, we embarked on
                    a mission to create an event that would not only commemorate
                    this sacred occasion but also foster a sense of belonging and togetherness among everyone who calls this diverse
                    community home. We are a group of 10 who volunteer our time and efforts with the same goal in mind, an event for
                    <b>EVERYONE</b>.
                </p>
                <h1>Our Goals</h1>
                <p> We aim to cater to everyone's needs and wants, however impossible that may seem. Innovation fuels
                    our creativity, pushing us to embrace new challenges and explore uncharted territories. Most
                    importantly, our community are at the heart of everything we do, listening to their needs and
                    implementing new ideas and tweaks is our utmost priority. </p>
                <h1>Join Us On Our Journey</h1>
                <p> We are incredibly grateful to our sponsors, volunteers and everyone to attends. Without the help,
                    these events would not be possible! <br>If you would like to get involved, please <br>
