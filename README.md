The eid festival

Being part of the eid festival management team, we are in the early stages of bringing things together. Initially only focusing on advertising and running the event on the day. This has work for the past 2 years however we are growing in popularity and as being the biggest eid festival in recent years in South Yorkshire. Recently starting our own instagram page and advertising with our charity partner Families Relief, there are certain elements are lacking but are currently looking into. We aim to be a non-profit therefore we rely heavily on sponsors and stall the upfront costs of the first 1-2 have been immense.Buying gazebos and miscelanious items that we can reuse are always a burden but the cost of the rides are something unavoidable and is 75% of our costs. 

Since we have no official website, I decided that my project should be to create a website that reflects our efforts to advertise to the local community and give a place for potential storeholders to register their interests. With the team, I went through ideas of my own and did some research as to what other people have done in the past.

We wanted something that shows what we are doing and how families of all sizes and ages can come along and have fun, catering to as may people as we can. Most imporantly, we wanted to show the turnout on the day for everyone to see and somewhere people can get in contact with us first and we can then break things down further as before we were having to use personal numbers and word of mouth to get into contact with us.

Navigation
Our logo fixed to the top left as well as bottom middle in the foot, both of which are linked to the main page as generally when using a website, the logos are always linked back. The navigation bar reacting to being in mobile website was taken from:

then adapted to fit the colour scheme of the website, Hex 76B9F0 being the official colour.
Colour scheme was predetermined by the poster layouts that we have been using. Leaving the font colour to be only white and black with not much variation. 
Having one page dedicated to photos was a must to attract potential stallholders and visitors in general
