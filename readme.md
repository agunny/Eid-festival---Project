# Sheffield Eid Festival 2023

This is a static website which can be updated which refresh photos to advertise and support the Eid Festival held in Sheffield twice a year. This will be to show potential stall holders and sponsors the amount of footfall for these events and for them to get into contact with us or just to attend the event before committing. Also to show our target audience, families, what there is to offer before attending.

## <a id="background"></a>Background

Being part of thet team, we are in the early stages of bringing things together. Initially only focusing on advertising and running the event on the day. This has worked for the past 2 years however we are growing in popularity and as being the biggest Eid festival in recent years in South Yorkshire, we draw crowds from as far as Birmingham! Our Previous event saw in excess of 10,000 people attend.<br>
Recently starting our own Instagram page and advertising with our charity partner Families Relief, there are certain elements are lacking but are currently looking into.<br>
Since we have no official website, I decided that my project should be to create a website that reflects our efforts to advertise to the local community and give a place for potential store holders to register their interests. With the team, I went through ideas of my own and did some research as to what other people have done in the past.

## <a id="goals"></a>Goals

### Attract new business

One of our ways of supporting the Eid Festival is to get local business to sponsor the events, with seeing the amount of footfall from previous events and the new spreading by word of mouth, having a centralised location where all the information and evidence is available means that everyone has a chance.

### Bring the community together

After Covid, normality was out the window. Eid fell just after the covid restrictions were lifted so we decided to do something to bring everyone together. Especially for the younger generation, in which the majority of their lives were revolving around masks and staying at home.

### A day of fun for everyone

We market this as the Eid Festival, however it's more of a family fun day for everyone, regardless of race, religion and age. One of the most infectious sights and sounds are young children laughing and having fun. It has a positive effect on everyone. It makes these events worth it to see everyone getting involved!

## <a id="colors"></a> **Colours and Typography**

Due to the previous designs of the posts and banners that we've used, it was already decided to use #76B9F0 has our main colour for background and overlays for images. Only white was text that would appear clearly on the foreground.
The complementary colour tone being #FOAD76, making things that have been hovered over to change to that colour to keep it standing out and for the change to be noticeable:

I chose to use poppins font as it was clean, modern and upon a glace, subtly styled.

## <a id="images"></a>**Images**

We've got a decent stockpile of images from the smaller events we did in the past. Therefore selecting images that best shows everthing we have on offer, froms food to rides.
Adding a #76B9F0 filter over the top with a 80% opacity to continue the colour scheme for the landing images on pages. Tingpng.com was used to compress the images.

## **Features**

### **Navigation**

In the nav bar, I used a horizontal menu for the desktop view and a hamburger menu for the mobile view. Logo in the top right linked back to the index page.

### Landing page

The landing page includes a background image of our previous event, showing the turn out with the views in the distance, rides and amount of footfall, intentionally done to give the users the impact the event has on the community.

Scrolling reveals a section with a brief introduction, as well as a link to the next location and a map embedded via google maps. The link also changes colour when hovered over to indicate a clickable link.

### Photos page

The photos page has a different background image from a different perspective of the previous event. Images are all from previous events, showing rides, stages shows and turnout on the day. All photos zoom in upon hovering, images can be updated in the future to show progression.

### Contact us

The contact us page is immediate met with a contact form as previous, we’ve relied on gathering the information personally, being able to centralise the process would allow us to ensure that people are being dealt with in a timely manner as well as being able to be seen by the group. This avoids confusion and will help streamline the process. Beneath also contains some more information on the terms and conditions.

### Future Implementations

In the future, I would like experiment with having a slideshow as the background image on the landing page to scroll through a few different images as opposed to a single static image, maybe changing it to a video entirely.

### Real world testing

Real world testing on a variety of devices:

* Laptop:
  * Alienware 15 R2
  * Macbook Pro (15in 2018)
  * Dell XPS 13 (9310)
  * Dell Latitude (5300)
* Mobile Devices:
  * Iphone 10
  * Iphone 14 Pro
  * Samsung S23 Ultra
  * Samsung Z Flip
* Tablets
  * Ipad Pro
  * Samsung Tab S

Tested using Samsung Interet, Safari, Google chrome (both mobile and desktop) and Edge.

### Bugs

The embedded map wouldn’t shrink with the changing of screen resolution, this was resolved by adding changing the fixed width to a viewpoint width which would keep it all in a good ratio regardless of screen width.

Images were being stretched and losing its clarity, also changing the spacing. I fixed this by display to block which centred the photos and increased the clarity of the image.

### Media and Content

As we host the events, I was able to take some time and take photos on the days. However, in the future we will be using a professional photographer to ensure high quality pictures and to potential produce videos. Photos of the rides were supplied by the company hired. Both to posted on our Instagram account and website. Logo was produced by myself also. The text was also written by myself however the terms and conditions were taken from the Eid Festival Stall forms.
