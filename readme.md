# Sheffield Eid Festival 2023

This is a static website which can be updated which refresh photos to advertise and support the Eid Festival held in Sheffield twice a year. This will be to show potential stall holders and sponsors the amount of footfall for these events and for them to get into contact with us or just to attend the event before committing. Also to show our target audience, families, what there is to offer before attending.

## Background

Being part of the Eid festival management team, we are in the early stages of bringing things together. Initially only focusing on advertising and running the event on the day. This has worked for the past 2 years however we are growing in popularity and as being the biggest Eid festival in recent years in South Yorkshire, we draw crowds from as far as Birmingham! Our Previous event saw in excess of 10,000 people attend.<br>
Recently starting our own Instagram page and advertising with our charity partner Families Relief, there are certain elements are lacking but are currently looking into.<br>
Since we have no official website, I decided that my project should be to create a website that reflects our efforts to advertise to the local community and give a place for potential store holders to register their interests. With the team, I went through ideas of my own and did some research as to what other people have done in the past.

## Goals
### Attract new business
One of our ways of supporting the Eid Festival is to get local business to sponsor the events, with seeing the amount of footfall from previous events and the new spreading by word of mouth, having a centralised location where all the information and evidence is available means that everyone has a chance.
### Bring the community together
After Covid, normality was out the window. Eid fell just after the covid restrictions were lifted so we decided to do something to bring everyone together. Especially for the younger generation, in which the majority of their lives were revolving around masks and staying at home.
### A day of fun for everyone
We market this as the Eid Festival, however it's more of a family fun day for everyone, regardless of race, religion and age. One of the most infectious sights and sounds are young children laughing and having fun. It has a positive effect on everyone. It makes these events worth it to see everyone getting involved!

## **Colours and Typography**
Due to the previous designs of the posts and banners that we've used, it was already decided to use #76B9F0 has our main colour for background and overlays for images. Only white was text that would appear clearly on the foreground.
The complementary colour tone being #FOAD76, making things that have been hovered over to change to that colour to keep it standing out and for the change to be noticeable:

I chose to use poppins font as it was clean, modern and upon a glace, subtly styled.

## **Images**
Since we've already got a decent stock of images from previous Eid Festival, I decided that using these images in the background, especially in the background, you can see many people. Flicking through the tabs there the general stalls, food stalls and rides in the background. Evidence of the amount of footfall at these events for potential future stall holders and sponsors. Add a blue overlay to these images to contiue with the theme of #76B9F0. Scrolling further through the site, there's more evidence of what's being provided in terms of children entertainment for our stage show. Filtering through and picking certain images as it shows a variety of people and children, all enjoying the shows on hand.<br>
These images were all compressed using tingpng.com to maximise performance due to the high quality of the images.

## **Features**

### **Navigation**

Our logo fixed to the top left as well as bottom middle in the foot, both of which are linked to the main page as generally when using a website, the logos are always linked back. Having a clean and simple design was a priority due to a mixed aged range of visitors on the days, I knew that a lot of grandparents bring their grandchildren, therefore I wanted something that was simple and easy to follow. However, having the navigation bar fixed at the top posed an issue when the screen sized changed. I knew the default answer was to have the items change into a drop down menu, therefore I used the channel below to style and address the issue:

This was adapted to fit the colour scheme of the website, #76B9F0. This was just an addition to the already existing navigation bar.

On screens bigger than 600px:

on screens smaller than 600px:

**Header**

Header font changes with the resolution of the screen to avoid the text becoming too large for the screen.

The same animation used for buttons on the screen for quick navigation to the other tab, with location being used, linked further down the main page, for the main information.

Background image used was from previous events held.

All subsequent pages follow the same style with the navigation bar and the header above.

Additional features for the future, to include a rolling background image/gif in the background to be more eye catching to users. Potentially sourced from the next Eid festival.

**Footer**

Footer includes links to the Instagram page, link the Families Facebook page where current advertising goes to, soon to be update with the Eid Festival Facebook page, as well as the Families relief website, our charity partner where all profits are donated to. 

Could add a separate space for sponsors either in the footer or above once terms and conditions have been applied to include such advertising.

**Main article**

Text changes colour to F0AD76 which is the complentary colour to the 76B9F0 as per <https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/> . This links to the map location of the event. Also clicking on the location button in the header automatically scrolls to this point in the page. Map link included to show the area. Image used in the background from previous event.

**Photos**

Photos using in a grid layout to show evidence from the previous events. Hovering over the images zooms in also to add another dimension.

Switches to 1 image at a time when viewed in a screen smaller than 600px horizontally.

**About us**

Simple page discussing the history and goals of the Eid festival.

**Contact us/Submission form**

` `Contact form for either getting involved with volunteering, enquiring about a stall or being a sponsor. More information to be distributed on contact.

Contact form to be filled out as necessary.

**Testing**

Website testing among a range of resolutions to ensure compatibility across mobile phones and desktop browsers alike.

Picked 600pixel horizontally to be the default resolution for the drop-down menu to appear as this is the “contact us” page defaults over 2 lines instead of staying as one.

Confirmed for the buttons on the header to stack depending on the size of the screen.

Images on the photos page when viewed in a smaller screen cut the image size too much, moving them to a 1 by 1 image type and then potentially in the future using a different image type/compressing the image to maintain image quality but improving responsiveness when loading the page.

Adding in a drop-down menu for the navigation bar was necessary to ensure that the navbar is always visible regardless of the screen size. Slight teething issues when scaling the resolution down more, the displacement of 100% wasn’t enough to keep it off the screen when checking, had to increase and test to ensure it wouldn’t be visible. Also changing the font size to keep it in check with the about of space on screen.

Potentially adding a link to the terms and conditions pages for the PDF versions, however due to having personal information on their, will need reworking before deploying.


**Bugs**

I found that when linking images, the image files must not have spaces as it causes it to flag as a problem, solved by including dashes instead of spaces.

I also found that the size of the text and the spacing was made difficult to read as it the page would split words depending on the resolution, therefore, to fix this included percentages where I could and clamp attribute when deciding a font size to ensure that the sizing remained appropriate for the resolution. 

Margins on the right was showing a white bar when the screen resolution was small enough. This was found out to be the problem of the map inserted, therefore CSS styling was using to combat this was to change the overflow to scroll.

**Validator testing**

HTML – no issues, warning however for genuine h1 heading.

CSS – No issues found by W3C CSS Validation Service.

Performance a little low due to high quality images used as background images.
